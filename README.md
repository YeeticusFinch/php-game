## How to play

Important Note: You play as a process running on AWS, so if Amazon or AWS goes down, you lose

WASD to move (unless you're on android, in which case you will have arrow keys)

2 scores to keep track of: RAM, credibility

This is a sidescroller shooter, you will see events appear on the screen and move right to left

You need to shoot each event with the correct gun, shooting with the wrong gun could have negative consequences

RAM usage is proportional to the amount of events currently on the screen

Shoot an event with the correct gun to remove it from the screen

If an event reaches the left side of the screen, then it's RAM increase becomes permanent


For example, suppose there is an incoming event labeled "HTML to be parsed", you want to aim at that and click "Execute operation"


When your credibility gets to low, people will try to shut down your php process, so you must retaliate by getting them fired.
